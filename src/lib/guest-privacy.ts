// Guest travel-document privacy.
//
// A host always sees their own guests' passport / ID data in full — it's
// theirs. But when a InnkeeperOS superadmin is *impersonating* a host for
// support, these document fields are redacted from every API response,
// so support can still operate the account (calendar, settings, sync)
// without ever reading a guest's passport details.
//
// This is what backs the assurance shown on the reservation page that
// InnkeeperOS staff cannot view uploaded passport documents. Redaction is
// applied at the API layer (guest list, guest search, data export) so
// there is no path — UI, search, or export — that leaks the data to an
// impersonating session.
