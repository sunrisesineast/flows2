              basis to process it (typically a hospitality-registration obligation under
              your local law) and that you have informed the guest. We act as your
              processor and will only process the data on your documented instructions.
              You are responsible for handling guest data-rights requests; we will
              assist you on request.

              The hosted Service is provided free of charge and &quot;as is&quot; and
              &quot;as available&quot;, without warranties of any kind, whether express
              or implied — including without limitation the implied warranties of
              merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and
              uninterrupted operation. We do not warrant that the Service will be free
              of errors, that calendars will sync without delay, or that backups will
              succeed every night. If the Service is critical to your business, please
              self-host so you control your own backups, uptime, and data residency.

            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Operator&apos;s
              total liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to the
              Service — whether in contract, tort, or otherwise — will not exceed the
              greater of (a) the total fees you paid us in the twelve months before the
              claim or (b) ten euros (€10). The Service is provided free of charge, so
              clause (a) is normally zero.

              We are not liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special,
              or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost or double-booked
              reservations, missed cleanings, calendar desync, lost guest data,
              regulatory fines you incur, or business interruption. Some jurisdictions
              do not allow these limitations; in those jurisdictions our liability is
              limited to the smallest amount allowed by law.

            <p>
              You agree to defend and indemnify the Operator from any claim, loss, or
              cost (including reasonable lawyer&apos;s fees) arising out of (i) content
              you upload, (ii) your use of the Service in breach of these Terms, or
              (iii) your violation of any third party&apos;s rights — including the
              rights of guests whose passport data you upload.

            <p>
              The hosted instance has no SLA. We aim for best-effort uptime and may take
              the Service offline for maintenance, migration, or — in extreme cases — to
              shut it down entirely. If we plan to shut the hosted instance down, we
              will notify registered users at least 30 days in advance with instructions
              to export their data. The open-source code will continue to be available
              under MIT for self-hosting regardless.

              You may stop using the Service at any time and delete your account from
              the Profile panel. We may suspend or terminate your account immediately
              if (a) we reasonably believe you have breached these Terms, (b) we are
              required to do so by law, or (c) prolonged inactivity (more than 24
              months) suggests the account is abandoned. We will give you reasonable
              notice and an opportunity to export data unless doing so would harm the
              Service or other users.

            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Operator&apos;s country of
              residence, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. Where mandatory
              consumer-protection law of your country applies, those rules continue to
              apply in addition. The parties will try to resolve any dispute informally
              first by emailing{" "}
              <a href={`mailto:${OPERATOR_EMAIL}`} className="text-sky-400 hover:underline">{OPERATOR_EMAIL}</a>.
              If that fails, the courts of the Operator&apos;s country of residence
              shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction.

            <p>
              We may update these Terms when the Service changes or when laws change.
              We will flag material updates inside the app and update the date at the
              top of this page. Past versions are visible in the public Git history of
              the open-source repository. Continued use of the Service after changes go
              live means you accept the updated Terms.

            <p>
              If any clause of these Terms is held unenforceable, the rest remains in
              force. Our failure to enforce a clause is not a waiver of our right to
              enforce it later. You may not assign your rights under these Terms; we
              may assign ours to a successor that takes over operation of the Service,
              with notice to you. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, form
              the entire agreement between you and us about the Service.
